- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chris-Willi
- 👀 I’m interested in WordPress
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to get along with YOAST

- 📫 How to reach me ...mardi@lasermax.fr
For the time being I am stuck with the fact that the Eye Marker doesn't work. My website theme is Enfold and I am working with the classic Editor (default editor)
